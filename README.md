# Rate Our Service App (React)

Hey! The purpose of this project is to improve my skills in using [React UI Library](https://reactjs.org/).

This is a beginner project that is using fundamentals of React:
 - Components,
 - JSX,
 - Props (proptypes, defaultprops),
 - States (component and root level),
 - Some simple styling,
 - Handling events,
 - Lists and keys,
 - Forms,
 - Context API,
 - HTTP Requests

As such, I intend to be updating this simple application and new features or support additional libraries.
